## Country and City Selector React App

This React application provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a country and its corresponding city from dropdown menus. It's designed to streamline the process of choosing locations without the hassle of navigating through a complex UI.

## Features

- **Dynamic Country and City Selection**: Users can select a country from the first dropdown menu, which then dynamically updates the second dropdown menu with cities from the selected country.
- **Search Functionality**: The city dropdown includes a search feature, allowing users to quickly find and select their desired city by typing its name.
- **Clear Selection**: A clear button is provided to easily reset both the country and city selections, enhancing the user experience by allowing for quick changes.
- **Jump to Google Maps**: A standout feature of this app is the ability to jump directly to Google Maps with the selected location. Once a country and city are selected, users can click the "Jump to Google Maps" button, which will open a new tab displaying the chosen location on Google Maps. This feature provides a seamless transition from selecting a location in the app to viewing it on a map, making it incredibly convenient for users who need to visualize the location or get directions.

## Getting Started

========================


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
